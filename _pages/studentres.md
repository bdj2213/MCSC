Samuel Barton is a sophomore at USM majoring in Computer Science. He is a MCSC Student Research Associate and specializes in computer programing. Samuel is working on The Sensor Project. 

The Sensor Project
The goal of this project is to create a secure, modular, and easy to install network of sensors that will gather data from network traffic to temperature. The project will also create a suite of software for reporting, analysis, and presentation of data collected. Such a sensor system does not currently exist, and current systems, which solve part of the problem, are expensive and insecure, as well as proprietary and, therefore, difficult to extend to new areas of study. Development of this system has required research into operating systems, and software creation in C, Perl, and Python. The significance of this project lies in its relative simplicity and extensibility new areas of study.


Eric Dubois is a senior at USM majoring in Information Communications Technology with a minor in Business Administration. He is a MCSC Student Research Associate with additional responsibilities as a MCSC student systems administrator. He specializes in computer hardware and networking. Eric is involved in two projects: The Naked Server and Experience a Cyber Event (EACE). 

The Naked Server and Experience a Cyber Event (EACE)
The Naked Server project investigates how to reduce the costs associated with running servers, especially how to reduce server energy use, while also increasing server longevity and improving server reliability. Experience a Cyber Event initiative entails the creation of a hands-on educational module that simulates real cybersecurity events and attacks. The tool is aimed toward the general public, and designed to increased participants' awareness of basic cybersecurity best practices. The goal is to promote secure online behavior by learning to identify and understand four commonly occurring cyber attacks.


Nicole Kearns is a senior at USM majoring in Information Technology. She is a MCSC Student Research Associate, Undergraduate Research Fellow, and Vice President of the Student Cybersecurity Organization. She specializes in ransomware. Nicole is working on three projects: Disaster Recovery Guide, Small Business Security Guide, and Ransomware: Social Engineering by Design. In addition, she is editor of the Small Business Security Guide, and author of the Disaster Recovery Guide. 

Ransomware: Social Engineering by Design
The Ransomware: Social Engineering by Design project seeks to identify, analyze, and evaluate the ways in which language is deployed in rogue antivirus software--a type of ransomware. The methodology involves word frequency tabulations and rhetorical analyses to determine whether common narratives occur through the use of specific words and phrases typically used in the software. One of the outcomes of this research is to establish a solid empirical basis for the creation of educational materials to increase users' awareness of the strategies used in ransomware, and thereby increase users' security online.


Melissa Miller is a junior at USM majoring in Information Technology, with a Cybersecurity concentration at USM. She is a MCSC Student Research Associate, and Treasurer of the Student Cybersecurity Organization. She specializes in technology in an educational setting. Melissa is working on two projects: The Maine Middle School and Maine High School Cybersecurity Project, and The PC Rescue Disk. 

The PC Rescue Disk.
The Maine Middle School and Maine High School Cybersecurity Project, and The PC Rescue Disk. The Maine Middle School and Maine High School Cybersecurity Project seeks to identify best practices for information technology hardware and software security configurations for teaching and learning in grades 6-12. The PC Rescue Disk work focuses on creating a resource to address and remediate security breaches. In addition, Melissa is Treasurer of the Student Cybersecurity Organization, and has presented her work at the first annual Cybersecurity Summit in Augusta, Maine in June, 2013, and at the Thinking Matters Student Research Symposium at USM in April, 2014.


Alex Weeman is a sophomore at USM majoring in Information Communications Technology. He is a MCSC Student Research Associate with additional responsibilities as a MCSC student systems and network administrator. He specializes in computer hardware and networking. Alex is involved in two projects: Statistics Servers and Experience a Cyber Event (EACE). 

Statistics Servers and Experience a Cyber Event (EACE)
The Statistics Servers project takes discarded servers--ones that would otherwise be scrapped--and refurbishes them to useful functionality. This work involves implementation of an Ubuntu operating system and installation of R statistical software. The restored servers provide processing power that can be used for solving statistical problems. Experience a Cyber Event initiative entails the creation of a hands-on educational module that simulates real cybersecurity events and attacks. The tool is aimed toward the general public, and designed to increased participants' awareness of basic cybersecurity best practices. The goal is to promote secure online behavior by learning to identify and understand four commonly occurring cyber attacks.
